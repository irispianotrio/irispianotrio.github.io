## Stories from the musicians

### Lauren

> A few days ago I played for Lily just a few hours before she passed. She had followed our project from the beginning.  We had laughed together and created music together. Up until she was placed on hospice a few months ago, she was a loyal listener, and never missed a rehearsal or concert.
>
> I have alway believed that my responsibility as a musician is to tap into the struggles and joys of the human condition.  In no moment do you understand this more clearly than walking into a room, knowing that your music will be the last sounds heard by a dear friend.
>
> This month, as we explore the relationship between music and spirituality, I’ve been reminded of the awesome power music has to give all stages of life more depth, more beauty, more meaning. Used correctly, in Lily’s room, it made all the difference: one last moment of connection, one last peaceful breath, one last smile.

### Sara

> On this particular day, when I walked into the memory care community, Mary complained that her hands were hurting. They were severely chapped and some ointment had just been put on the open wounds.  She thought there should be music to take away the pain so we composed an eight-bar song about her aching hands, which brought some humor to the situation.   Somewhere along the way she forgot about how much they actually hurt.  We then segued into singing Yiddish folk songs which is usually how we spend time together.  She will sing in Yiddish, translate, and then explain to me how the songs reflect Jewish culture and values.

## Marjorie’s story

*Presented at a luncheon in June 2017*

> How wonderful you all are to recognize and endorse the profound impact music has had on our community.  When Robert Browning wrote, “Grow old with me/the best is yet to be”, I don’t think he’d even hit 70.  Growing old is hard, and it’s especially daunting in this age of Adoring Youth in all its glory.  Each one of us has our singular story, but I’ll bet you practically anything that given the chance, we’d rather be at least 20 years younger, running around busy as bees.  It’s exciting to be able constantly to look forward, the the next best job, or invention, or play, or whatever makes life interesting for you.  A whole lot less wonderful when you can’t hit the tennis ball because your knee buckled, or retirement turns out to be more boring than exhilarating.  I could go on and on, but you all know the words to this particular song, and here’s where music enters.

> My arrival here was abrupt, unexpected and traumatic  The past 5 years had been nothing but loss, illness and death.  The moment is burned into my mind when the doctor put both hands on my shoulders and said, Marjorie, the man you married is gone.”  I’m positive all of you have experienced some moment when the arc of your life stops short. Everything familiar disappears; you’re suddenly facing a horrifying new reality. Now, I know everyone think their marriage is special, but ours truly was. Possibly because my husband was both a playwright and an Advertising Creative Director, our friends tended to be a lot more unconventional than our Westchester neighbors. Our days were filled with laughter, wild conversations, insanity and adventure! Then came the deadly diagnosis. And a few years later, Don ultimately slipped away forever.

> Now, even with an army of help, my future looked anything but promising. When my niece found me an apartment five floors down from hers in Chevy Chase my life seemed to calm down. I knew nothing about Maryland, and knew no one but Debby and her husband. Although life was dramatically different, the arc of day to day living was again going up, and there was lots to look forward to. I moved to Chevy Chase in August. Suddenly, without any warning at all, the cancer Deb had conquered 17 years before reappeared. Two months later she died. Chaos.  My house in Westchester had been sold, my children were hundreds of miles away. Everyone around me agreed I couldn’t live alone, and social workers kept showing me places they assured me I would love. I hated them. I moved, still depressed, and still convinced that the arc of my life was rapidly going downhill.  I looked forward to nothing.

> About a week later, I was walking down the halls towards my apartment when I heard one of the most beautiful sounds in the world: someone was practicing the cello!  I stood outside the door, hardly able to breath.  A few minutes later, out came a young woman, with warm brown eyes, carrying her cello on her back.  And that’s how I met Lauren, “Oh, you’re new” she said “Do you like music?” I not only liked it, I explained, I was a pianist, a long, long time ago.  “Then you can help us with our chamber music,” she said enthusiastically.  But I told her that not only had I never played chamber music, but I’d never even seen a score.  “You can coach us,” she said.  “No, I can’t,” I protested.  I’ve coached actors, and worked in theater, but I knew nothing about what you’re telling me I can do.  You’ll figure it out she answered, with complete confidence.  With that, she handed me the score of a Brahms trio, and said we’d meet the following week.  So I said to myself, ok….I’m 87, I know zip about what this young woman is asking me to do, but why don’t I just give it a shot?  I began listening to recordings and attending Lauren, Sara and Jessica’s rehearsals.  And that, folks, is how the Iris Trio gave me back my life.  I look up performances of the trio on YouTube, took the score, and tried to follow the notes of three instruments instead of my familiar piano scores.

> At first I was lost … it isn’t easy to learn something new.  But it took all of my attention, concentration and after two hours I actually could follow it.  I cannot describe how this changed my life, not only because rehearsals are my favorite things, but I discovered that the sun hadn’t set.  The arc of my life began to go up again.  And this is what the Iris Trio does; they encourage people to try new things and be engaged in relevant discussions.  *This is, in no uncertain terms, a miracle.*
