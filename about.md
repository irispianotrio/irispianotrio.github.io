## Iris Piano Trio

As the Iris Piano Trio, cellist, Lauren Latessa, violinist Sara Matayoshi and pianist Jessica McKee collaborate alongside older adults and caregivers, curating a rotation of professional chamber music concerts, open rehearsals, participatory group programs and one-on-one sessions. The  Iris Piano Trio is embedded in the community twenty hours each week, forty week a year. The result of these experiences is a vibrant community dedicated to using music as a tool for social transformation.

Additionally, the 2018-2019 season includes performances and presentations at the Peabody Conservatory, the Arts Club of Washington and the Music at St. Albanâ€™s concert series in Davidson North Carolina.  

The trio is named for the Greek Goddess, Iris, who was the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods. The image of a rainbow and the spirit of hope that is often attributed to rainbows serves as inspiration for the group as they pursue their art.
