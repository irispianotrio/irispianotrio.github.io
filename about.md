title: About the Iris Piano Trio
---

Violinist Sara Matayoshi, cellist Lauren Latessa and pianist Jessica McKee formed the Iris Piano Trio in September of 2016 with the dual mission of performing chamber music at the highest level and creating meaningful musical experiences for seniors.

The group serves as the ensemble in residence for The Music Project in Rockville, MD. In this role, the trio collaborates with elders from three retirement homes, working in independent living, assisted living and memory care contexts.  Each year they curate an annual rotation of concerts, open rehearsals, participatory group programs, and one-on-one sessions designed specifically for these communities. The Music Project is a first-of-its-kind experiment at the intersection of creative aging and creative placemaking.

The 2018 year includes performances and presentations at the Peabody Conservatory, the Arts Club of Washington and the Music at St. Alban’s concert series in Davidson North Carolina.  Additionally, in March, the trio will host and present *Ladies First*, a week long celebration of women in the arts.

In Greek Mythology the goddess Iris was thought to use the rainbow as a bridge between heaven and earth, while the petals of the Iris flower are said to symbolize faith, valor and wisdom. These metaphors captures the holistic spirit of the Iris trio’s work. Both in concert and through their commitment to their elderly neighbors, they are dedicated to using music to provide peace, comfort and spiritual fulfillment for the most vulnerable members of their community.
