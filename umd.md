## Residency at University of Maryland

***An Alternative Path: Chamber Music in Unexpected Places***

*A residency on entrepreneurship and creative, meaningful engagement with different kinds of audiences*

Tuesday, October 17, 2017

Join the Iris Piano Trio (violinist Sara Matayoshi, cellist Lauren Latessa, and pianist Jessica McKee) at 11am in Room 2201 (Choral Room) for a lecture/discussion on the intersections of chamber music and community engagement. The trio will present their visionary work and its potential impact on elderly citizens across the country. Additionally, they will discuss the many ways that musicians can incorporate this type of work into their professional lives, building unique and artistically rewarding paths. The School of Music is just beginning a partnership with Collington, a Continuing Care Retirement Community, and the work of the Iris Piano Trio in this area aligns nicely with our own priorities regarding community engagement.

Student Reactions

This changed my whole perspective - now I know what I want to do with my life!

I was so inspired by this work and it leaves me with a sense of what might be possible for musicians today.
