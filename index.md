### Note from Artistic Director, Lauren Latessa 

A few days ago, I played for Lily just hours before she passed. She had followed our project from the beginning. We had laughed together and created music together. Up until she was placed on hospice a few months ago, she was a loyal listener, and never missed a rehearsal or concert. 

I have alway believed that my responsibility as a musician is to tap into the struggles and joys of the human condition. In no moment do you understand this more clearly than walking into a room, knowing that your music will be the last sounds heard by a dear friend. 

The Iris Music Project is dedicated to exploring this connection between music and spirituality.  I have personally spent many hours contemplating it as I helplessly watch my own Mom struggle with a cancer that has returned five times. Through all this, I have reaffirmed my belief that music has the awesome power to give all stages of life more depth, more beauty, more meaning. Used correctly, in Lilyâ€™s room, it made all the difference: one last moment of connection, one last peaceful breath, one last smile.
