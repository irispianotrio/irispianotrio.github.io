## Stories from the musicians

### Sara

> On this particular day, when I walked into the memory care community, Mary complained that her hands were hurting. They were severely chapped and some ointment had just been put on the open wounds.  She thought there should be music to take away the pain so we composed an eight-bar song about her aching hands, which brought some humor to the situation.   Somewhere along the way she forgot about how much they actually hurt.  We then segued into singing Yiddish folk songs which is usually how we spend time together.  She will sing in Yiddish, translate, and then explain to me how the songs reflect Jewish culture and values.
