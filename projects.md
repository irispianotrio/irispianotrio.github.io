# Iris Piano Trio Residency at University of Maryland

## An Alternative Path: Chamber Music in Unexpected Places

A residency on entrepreneurship and creative, meaningful engagement with different kinds of audiences.

##### Tuesday, October 17, 2017

Join the Iris Piano Trio (violinist Sara Matayoshi, cellist Lauren Latessa, and pianist Jessica McKee) at 11am in Room 2201 (Choral Room) for a lecture/discussion on the intersections of chamber music and community engagement. The trio will present their visionary work and its potential impact on elderly citizens across the country. Additionally, they will discuss the many ways that musicians can incorporate this type of work into their professional lives, building unique and artistically rewarding paths. The School of Music is just beginning a partnership with Collington, a Continuing Care Retirement Community, and the work of the Iris Piano Trio in this area aligns nicely with our own priorities regarding community engagement.

##### Thursday, October 19, 2017

The Iris Trio performs a short program with narrative at 11am in the Leah Smith Hall for chamber music students and all other interested persons.
