## Violinist, Sara Matayoshi

Sara Matayoshi, violinist, has earned recognition for her artistry as a solo, chamber, and orchestral musician, since making her solo debut with the Midwest Young Artist Orchestra in 2002. A former core member of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, Sara has also been a member of the Chicago Civic, Madison, Des Moines Metro Opera, and Atlantic Symphony Orchestras.  As a chamber musician, she was the former violist of the Oak Ridge String Quartet and violinist with the SKY Piano Trio and Juventas New Music Ensemble.  She was also a member of the Knoxville Symphonyâ€™s Music and Wellness Quartet where she trained with music therapist, Alana Seaton, to cater music for various health care settings.  The KSO was awarded a grant that enabled all the members of the quartet to become Certified Music Practitioners (CMP) through the Music Healing and Transition Program. CMPs are trained to design one-on-one therapeutic music sessions for comfort care. Sara currently has experience offering these sessions in hospital settings ranging from the Neonatal Intensive Care, Oncology, Cardiovascular, and Cancer units to hospice and skilling nursing facilities.  Outside of her work with the Iris Piano Trio, Sara is currently a violinist with A Musical Heart (a group of classical musicians that offer music in hospice facilities) and acting principal second of the National Philharmonic Orchestra.
